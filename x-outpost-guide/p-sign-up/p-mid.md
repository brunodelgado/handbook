# Mid-Outpost

## Arrival

You've arrived at the destination airport, nice! If you're meeting other X-Teamers at the airport, this would be the time to find a comfy place to wait for them. While waiting, there are a few things you can get done to make life easier for everyone, once they arrive:

* Check the currency exchange rates. Some airports have rip-off rates, but if you compare to what the interbank rate is \(check google\), you'll know if it sounds close enough to what you're willing to pay.
* Unless the guardian is taking care of that, check the local mobile data plans on offer. Chances are, you'll have to do it yourself, as most countries now require a copy of your passport when you get a SIM card. If there are several providers, make sure you get one with good coverage for the area you're specifically going to.
* Check which direction you have to go to get to the public transit, if you're taking that. Otherwise, find out \(online/in-app\) where uber or the local equivalent will be able to pick you up. In some places, taxi drivers are violently hostile towards uber drivers, so unless instructed otherwise, one person should sit up front with the driver. If you're taking public transit, figure out how it works.
* Wait for everyone to arrive.

## AirBnB

Everyone probably isn't going to arrive at the same time or even within a few hours, so people who arrive sooner may want to settle into rooms already. There are a few guidelines on assigning rooms so it's optimal and fair:

* If two or more X-Teamers are sharing a room, they should get the biggest rooms \(by room size\) with ensuite bathrooms, if possible.
* X-Teamers with plus-ones should get the next biggest \(by bed size\) rooms, also with ensuite bathrooms, if possible.
* X-Teamers who have rooms to themselves get what's left.

If it's a tropical environment and some rooms have AC while others don't, it's nice to figure out a system to trade rooms so it's not just a few people who have to suffer through unless they don't mind.

## Activities

The guardian will usually provide several suggestions for activities. If you like those, great. If not, you should always feel free to propose an activity that could be done together, but also be understanding and compassionate if your idea meets with reluctance or indecision. Some people might just need a day or two away from socializing, to recharge their batteries, especially after a grueling 20+hour flight. Also, keep in mind that the guardian is there to facilitate things, but is not a concierge or butler! Treat them as you would a friend - which we hope you are or will have become by the end of the outpost - not as staff.

Activities will mostly take place on weekends. Sometimes, everyone arranges for time off at the same time, so something can be done together, but aiming for weekends is a surefire way that most people can participate.

## Something has gone wrong...

If it's not super-time-sensitive, talk to the guardian. In cases of e.g. medical emergency, definitely seek professional help first, but letting the guardian know what's happening is both useful - they may have some advice on how to handle the situation - and nice - they won't be worried if everything is OK with you. Definitely talk to the guardian about what to do in case you get stopped by the police, as the "solutions" vary immensely throughout the world.

## Have fun!
