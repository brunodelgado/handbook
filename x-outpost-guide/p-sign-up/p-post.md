# Post-Outpost

The outpost is over. Hopefully, you've made some awesome memories and new friends, or you've reinforced the preexisting friendships. In the next few days, you should receive a feedback form from the guardian. It's anonymous, so please be completely honest. It's not there to determine whether the guardian needs to be punished, but for us to figure out how we can improve future outposts. Also, the guardian will provide you with access to a google drive folder, where you can upload your photos and videos, which would help us create an awesome outpost overview video and blog.
