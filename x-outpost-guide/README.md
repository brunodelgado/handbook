# X-Outpost Guide

Who doesn't like working from home or, indeed, anywhere on the planet? Silly question, right? That's why we here at X-Team created the X-Outpost.

## What are X-Outposts?

Outposts are roaming hacker-houses packed with action, exciting activities, and opportunities to hang out with other X-Teamers as well as with local dev communities. However, during the week, both provide a stable work environment. Each month, the X-Outpost moves to a different place in the world.

## Why do we host them?

It's an excellent opportunity to hang out and experience awesome stuff together with colleagues. Moreover, you can exchange knowledge and share feedback on the company, and at some outposts, you can also build relationships with local communities of developers interested in remote work, unleashing their potential, and X-Team.

## Where do they take place?

Outposts happen throughout the world, on all continents, in any country we determine is safe and interesting enough for X-Teamers to visit.

## When do they happen?

It depends. We usually work with the X-Teamer that knows the potential location for a future outpost to determine the best time of year for the outpost to take place. We try to spread them out throughout the year, however.

## Who runs them? Who can participate?

Every outpost has a guardian. Guardians are X-Teamers that volunteered as tributeâ€¦ Err, I mean, as local guides who commit themselves to choosing a location for an Outpost, finding accommodation and serving participants with their knowledge about the local reality. They will give you insight on how to move around, where and where not to go, what to see, etc.

Keep in mind, though, that while they will do their best to help you feel comfortable in an area, they are not there to organize an entertainment schedule on a daily basis. Please, appreciate their effort put into setting the Outpost up for you, and try your best to equally contribute organizational effort for the benefit of the whole group should they feel like today is the day for socializing.

Participation is open to all members of the X-Team community, though we do give preference to people, who've been to fewer outposts in the past, so if you're an Outpost-newbie, don't hesitate to apply to one - chances are very good you'll get one of the 6 places per outpost. The only condition is that you're currently on a paid project - internal or with a partner - and that you've been with us for at least a month.

While most outposts allow you to bring your better half with you, we try to host at least one every year where we invite whole X-Families to participate.

An outpost is a collaborative experience, and while there's a leader - the guardian - it comes down to everyone to make it a great experience.

## How do I get in?

Good to hear you're so excited!
