# Representing X-Team

Many X-Teamers come to us and ask how they could help represent X-Team at events they frequent. We love to hear this, and we're always happy to help out. The approaches are a bit different based on what you'd like to do, but in every case let us know and try to get us a recording we can share.

## Just attending an event

The best thing you can do is wear some of the swag you can get in the [vault](https://xhq.x-team.com/vault). Our t-shirts have a tendency of attracting attention =\)

## Participating in an event

### Giving a talk

If the organizers are OK with it, you can include a pre-prepared presentation video we have for just such occasions. If you'd prefer to talk about us yourself, you can talk to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6), and he'll help you put together a good X-Team presentation.

### Giving an X-Team presentation

If you're straight up focused on just giving a presentation about X-Team, we definitely want to hear about it. Talk to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) and he'll provide you with the various materials you can use in your X-Team presentation and even help you put the whole thing together, if you'd like.
