# Advice from X-Team Veterans

* @michal.miszczyszyn - Don't be afraid to ask questions.
* @Carlos Cruz - Be Honest. Any question that an X-Teamer ask you, always say the truth.
* @grant.bartel - Don't die. JK :\) Explore the channels that interest you and enjoy the fun.
* @Ed - Engage with the community through channels of topics that interest you. Bounties are a great way to do that!
* @smaryka - There is lots going on in this community. Don't get caught up trying to do everything. You'll have no time to work if you do. Pick a few things you enjoy, and enjoy them. It is a great community. You will be entertained.
* @mattmilburn - Introduce yourself to people and ask questions.
* @javisperez - Keep a good attitude, this is a great community and even though sometimes there's a lot of work, time has shown me that we try to behave as a team, so, there's no "too many questions", no "it's too basic" or "it's not worth mentioning". If you need help, ask, and if somebody asks you anything, try to give that person a lot of help because we're a community and we're trying to keep positive vibes and in the end we're all developers, we all love to learn new stuff so we ask and answer questions. Remember to always be a team player, even in the night-time!
* @mbartos - What would you do if you weren't afraid?
* @kasper - Never sit easy! Keep updating your skills, ask questions and trust in the community.
