## Introduction

Welcome to X-Team. Many developers before you have started on this same page and gone on to do the best work of their careers and explored the world and their passions more than ever before.

This guide will get you up to speed with what you absolutely must know to get started as an X-Teamer, especially as you embark on adventures throughout the world as a location-independent digital nomad.

The guide is written so that you can jump in anywhere â€” don't feel like you have to read it from the beginning to the end. Above all, make sure you start joining some [Slack channels](http://x-team.com/missions/slack) and start getting a taste for all of the opportunities available for you to live more energized while you work from anywhere.
