# X-Summit 2020

![](../.gitbook/assets/x-summit-2020.jpg)

The X-Summit, normally held in-person at an [epic location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD-k9hY9E-A), is going all-online this year for a week-long event unlike any we've ever put together.

The tradition of the X-Summit is to come together **to witness the unexpected, to do things we've never done, to behold and bear witness to moments that will forever be uniquely ours.**

And this year is no different. We want to help you summon more energy than ever before in 2020. To break your routine and crack open your mind again from a new experience.

[For all breaking news and updates, check the \#x-summit-2020 channel on Slack.](https://app.slack.com/client/T0257R0RP/C017JFT1Y8H)

Here's a first-look at what you can expect:

## **Tuesday \(Sept. 1\)**

### **Opening Ceremony**

Last year's champions were House Wolfpack after a controversial step count. But with House Wolfpack no longer active after losing in Season 4, the championship is now vacant and up for grabs.

Compete for your House, earning points by tracking your total steps and posting them to \#vs. Use any step tracker.

The House with the most steps after 24 hours win the Championship and **will earn their House's exclusive X-Summit 2020 Championship t-shirt:**

The final Vault drop of Season 6 will arrive on Thursday, featuring a design from community member Oliver Diaz, brother of Ariel Diaz. You'll want to catch this one before its limited run is gone. It also marks the last item of the past decade's collection!
