Last year's X-Summit is certainly hard to beat considering we took over a castle and had one of the most memorable weekends ever.

And while we can't gather in-person this year, it doesn't mean we still can't try to top last year's event. And for the past months, we've been hard at work at doing just that.

This year's X-Summit will be entirely online, meaning anyone can participate.

* An opening ceremony unlike anything we've ever done
* Big announcements we've been waiting to drop
* All-new House VS competitions
* Open bar Zoom parties
* Tons of side parties -- poker, board games, live DJ, cook together, the list goes on...
* The Box returns...at everyone's doorstep.
* And more...

We'll keep this page updated with more information, but the first news you'll hear has to do with The Box...
