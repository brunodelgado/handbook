Join us **December 17th** for our final mega-event of the year that assembles all of X-Team. And this year, X-Mas 2020 is raising the bar once again.

**Put simply: you don't want to miss it.** 

Here's a rundown of what you can expect on December 17th.

## **X-Mas 2020 Livestream**

If you only experience one piece of X-Mas 2020, make sure it's this. Best experienced live, the X-Mas 2020 livestream will give you your last energy boost of the year and a taste of what's to come in X-Team's future.

Enjoy some epic jams, heartfelt moments, hype for the future, and of course, plenty of memes.

This year's pre-show features [X-Team Radio](https://radio.x-team.com)'s \#1 retrowave DJ, [_**Sung**_](https://sung-music.bandcamp.com/), who will deliver an epic live set exclusively for X-Team. Most retrowave DJs don't perform live, so it's a rare experience.

Get a taste for his retrowave music below:
