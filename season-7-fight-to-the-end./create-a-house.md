# Create a House

## Houses Explained

**Houses are the 'guilds' or 'micro-communities' within the greater X-Team Community. They're a great way to meet other X-Teamers and gain exclusive privileges and rewards.**

Houses compete in Events each Season, working together to earn [**Luna**](guide.md#introducing-luna) to buy [**House Perks**](house-perks.md), such as winning big prizes for their members or exclusive House-branded Vault items, and soon many other obtainable privileges.

**Starting in Season 7, we're giving you the power to start your own House.**

## **House Formation Requirements & Steps**

To form a House, you'll need to meet the following criteria:

* Must have at least **5 members** committed
* Must have at least **1** **leader** identified \(up to 3\)
* Must have chosen a **name** & **philosophy** \(what you stand for\) for your House
* Pay the **25 coin formation fee** -- this is to ensure only the most serious Houses are formed.

2. Then, you will be walked through the process for getting your House's **exclusive Sigil created.**
